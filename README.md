This is a code of PC C# app, which intercepts output from touchless gesture sensor, interprets them and sends appropriate commands to Philips Hue bridge to change lights in your surrounding.

The output of the gesture sensor contains 4 fields: hand pose code, performed gesture code, hand position in _x_ axis, hand position in _y_ axis (both number expressed in percentage).

Research utilizing this application is to be presented at IECON'18.
